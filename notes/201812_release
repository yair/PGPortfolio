Should be first cloud trained release, to explore features that our beyond our current memory constraints.
todo:
1. Fix namespace issue with tcn dropout (i.e. fugly hack)
2. Move DB from sqlite to PG.
3. Consider externalizing some of the hyperparams for automatic searches.
4. Explore attention, highway (expressway? whatever) and gated features of tcn.
5. explore modifying loss function to make a better policy (A3C, trusted region, other PG improvement. The bootcamp videos are a good start).
6. Explore moving to dropout to another regularization technique which is presumably more 'rl friendly'.
