Turn the fees (transaction cost) to a vector, and set it from real data accumulated from buying. That won't be live, but at least penalize less liquid coins.

We need to first remove config['trading']['trading_consumption'] from the code. It exists in --
-- NNAgent, where it's used inside the NN proccing,
-- trade/trader.py, where it's used in backtesting. (skip for now?)

Where is it imported to be used with the benchmark algos? Prolly the backtesting code. Bleh. Will we have to modify them?

Ok, we have the raw info loaded into the config, where do we calc the vector and push it to NNAgent? Well, matmul, natch.

==========

Important -- Different consumptions for each coin might fuck up completely the whole notion that the same agent can be used for all coins. This might be fundamentally unworkable.
Does consumption even taken into account before voting? Where _exactly_ is it used? Only in the loss function calculation? Is that enough?
