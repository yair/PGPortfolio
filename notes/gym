To use spinningup code, or most other things, we need to expose PGP as a gym environment and use it there. This is fundamentally different than the way it is currently exposed because we tackle sequences as a batch and solve all steps simultaneously, while gym (and rl in general) solves sequences, well, sequentially.
It'll be icky, but there's no real other way forward.
We can't even do reward-to-go right now, not to mention any of the value, value-action, advantage etc. functions.
It will also probably take 2.7 bazillion years to train. Bleh.
